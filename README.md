# proof-of-concept

This repository contains Proof of Concepts (PoC) for different technologies and programming languages. The goal is to experiment, demonstrate specific functionalities, and solve common technical problems pragmatically.

## Repository Structure

- **poc-java-concurrency**: Example of how to implement concurrency in Java. This module includes tests for common patterns such as `ExecutorService`, `ForkJoinPool`, and others.

## Objectives

1. **Rapid Exploration**: Allow quick testing of ideas, new APIs, and patterns without needing a complete project.
2. **Learning**: Create examples that help me learn or teach specific concepts related to different programming languages.
3. **Documentation and Reference**: Maintain a reference place to revisit learned concepts.

## Languages Used
